# notsiege development

**This site is a WIP (work in progress)**

notsiege development was formed in 2021 by notsiege (aka siege). I created the organization because I wanted to work on development and share my creations with the community (most of them, at least). I do some private work for various reasons, but most of my work is open-source. I personally believe that if something is useful and it would benefit the overall community, it should be publicly available. I am more than happy to help with things I know how to do, so if you need help, my discord is [here](https://discord.gg/3wbEfcJy2A). I may occasionally publish tutorials on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS67VERkTCz-azyw_Lrsh2A).
