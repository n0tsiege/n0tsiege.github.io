# notsiege-dev.github.io
notsiege-dev's github site

My site is an open-source page that has docs/FAQs for my work, contact details, licenses and copyright info for my projects and repositories, along with details about notsiege development.

While this is open-source, please read the LICENSE file also included on the [repo](https://github.com/notsiege-dev/notsiege-dev.github.io)

While the license I use cannot limit this, I do personally ask of you that, if you do decide to use any of this code, that you use your own descriptions/names (although I don't truly know why you would use mine if this is a project for yourself/your organization ðŸ¤·).
